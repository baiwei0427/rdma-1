\subsection{Summary}
We have shown that DCQCN has a unique fixed point, where all flows get a fair
share of the bottleneck bandwidth. For typical parameter values flows converges
to this fixed point within 100ms. DCQCN generally stable around this fixed
point, and $R_{AI}$ and $K_{max}$ can be tuned if needed.  However, a
PI-controller based approach may be the more principled way to ensure stability
and fixed queue length.
