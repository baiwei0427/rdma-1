\subsection{Summary}
We have shown that DCQCN has a unique fixed point, where all flows get a fair
share of the bottleneck bandwidth. For typical parameter values flows converge
to this fixed point exponentially.
%within 100ms. 
DCQCN is generally stable around this fixed
point, and $R_{AI}$ and $K_{max}$ can be tuned if needed.  However, a
PI-controller based approach may be the more principled way to ensure stability
and fixed queue length.
