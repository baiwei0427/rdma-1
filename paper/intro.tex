\section{Introduction}

%  Basic motivation.

Motivation: rdma being deployed. needs congestion control. dcqcn was proposed by Microsoft and Mellanox,
ships in Mellanox cards. uses ecn markings. timely was proposed by google. uses
delay difference. as rdma becomes more widely deployed, which protocol should
people adopt? requires careful, control theoretic analysis of the two
protocols, which was not done
by either. 


% What we do.
control theoretic analysis via fluid models, backed by simulations.
our primary goal is to derive stability criteria
like~\cite{dctcp-analysis}, but we also discover interesting behaviors. 

% summary of findings.
we find that ...
