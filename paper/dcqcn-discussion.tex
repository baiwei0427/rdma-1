\subsection{Summary}
We have shown that DCQCN has a unique fixed point, where all flows get a fair
share of the bottleneck bandwidth. For typical parameter values flows converges
to this fixed point within 100ms. DCQCN generally stable around this fixed
point, an $R_{AI}$ and $K_{max}$ can be tuned to ensure stability, if needed.
However, a PI-controller based approach is perhaps the more principled way to
ensure stability and fixed queue length.
