\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

There is a vast amount of literature on congestion signals (drop, ECM delay),
congestion control algorithms and their analysis. See~\cite{srikantbook} for a
succinct overview. Below, we discuss only a few representative papers.

In~\cite{dctcp-analysis} and ~\cite{qcn-analysis}, Alizadeh et.al. analyze the
DCTCP~\cite{dctcp} and QCN~\cite{qcn} protocols that DCQCN is derived from.
These papers served as useful guideposts during for our work.

Fluid model analysis of TCP under the RED AQM controller, and subsequent
development of the PI controller was reported
in~\cite{misra2000fluid,hollot2001designing}. Our exploration of the PI
controller for DCQCN and TIMELY is guided by results
in~\cite{hollot2001designing}.

A number of congestion control protocols where the bottleneck switch or a
central controller plays a more active role have been proposed.  For example,
RCP~\cite{dukkipati2006rcp} and XCP~\cite{katabi2002congestion}~require the
switches to send more detailed feedback, while proposals
like~\cite{vattikonda2012practical,deadline,perry2014fastpass} use an omniscient
central controller for fine grain scheduling and pFabric~\cite{pfabric}~is a
timeout based congestion control that requires switches to sort packets.
Comparison of these protocols to ECN and delay-based protocols is outside the
scope of this paper.
