\subsection{Summary}
We showed that the TIMELY protocol, as proposed in~\cite{timely} can have
infinite fixed point, since it relies on RTT gradient. We proposed a small fix
to address the problem, and showed that the resulting protocol converges to a
fixed point, where all flows share the bottleneck bandwidth equally. The
protocol is stable around this fixed point, as long as the number of flows is
not too high.
